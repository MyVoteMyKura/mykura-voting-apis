## About MyKura

MyKura is a remote election management and voting system, whose main purpose is to ensure secure and verifiable voting utilizing blockchain concepts. @gwatai made the project open source to invite more software engineers to save democracy for the following reasons:

- Rigged elections cause corruption
- Physical voting causes a lot of pain such as the closing down of schools, no working, and CO2 emissions
- Murder of Phsical elections officials eg in Kenya Chris Musando(RIP) a critical official in charge of ICT was brutally murdered in the Kenya 2017 General elections
- The above is mainly because of great the human input required in managing a physical election
- ... add many more reasons

MyKura is a Secure, accessible, and fast voting platform
